# Godot Skeleton

Template repository for getting started with a new Godot project quickly. Godot Skeleton handles the boring stuff like main menu, pause menu, settings that persist and load from disk, and structuring your project.

Godot versions supported: 4.0+

_Note: Godot Skeleton is in its infancy. It works, but not much is documented and it'll be changing quickly._

## Bugs/Features

- Mouse, keyboard, and controller support by default
- Sensible defaults
- Convention over configuration
- Easy to change
- Ship quickly, ship often
- Developed with all platforms in mind
- Minimal yet stylish
- Each scene has its own folder
- Preconfigured exports for Web, Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Use It

- Go to https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_skeleton and click "Use this template"
- Or [download the source](https://github.com/brettchalupa/godot_skeleton/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it, and you're good to go!

## Set Your Game Up

2. Configure exports
    - Change the bundle identifier for the MacOS export
    - Add or modify based on your game's needs

## Notes

- Don't worry about keeping your game up to date with Godot Skeleton. It's intended to just be a starting point. When you use it again, it may have some improvements!
- Gameplay defaults to a 2D scene, but you can easily change that for your game's needs.
- Keyboard controls:
    - Config I:
        - Directional input: WASD
        - Confirm: J

    - Config II:
        - Directional input: Arrows
        - Confirm: Z
        - Cancel: X
        - Pause: Esc
- Joypad controls: Xbox config where bottom button is confirm
